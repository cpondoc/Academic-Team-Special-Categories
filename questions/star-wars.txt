Definition: Bossk (meaning "Devours His Prey" in Dosh) was a male Trandoshan bounty hunter who was the pilot of the Hound's Tooth and held the title of monarch of the Qotile system.[6] He was not particularly fond of Chewbacca and his Human partner Han Solo. He would face them several times, and would be one of the six bounty hunters Darth Vader hired to track down and capture the Millennium Falcon. Despite the fact that Bossk loved to hunt and skin Wookiees, he would unknowingly aid in the freeing of hundreds of Wookiee slaves on the island world of Lomabu III. He was also a frequent partner and foe of both Boba Fett and Zuckuss, both fellow bounty hunters. After being repeatedly beaten by Boba Fett, Bossk would eventually boost his reputation as a bounty hunter by defeating Fett on Tatooine.

Term: Ki-Adi-Mundi
Definition: Ki-Adi-Mundi was a male Cerean Jedi Master of the Jedi Order who served on the High Council in the twilight years of the Galactic Republic and played a major role in several battles during the Clone Wars. Born in 92 BBY, Mundi was discovered at age four by the Jedi An'ya Kuro and became one of the few permitted by the Jedi Order to be trained starting beyond infancy. After more than two decades as a Padawan to Master Yoda, Mundi was named a Jedi Knight and returned to Cerea to liberate his home village from a gang of raiders. Assigned the Jedi Watchman of the Cerean sector, Mundi was granted a rare exception to the Jedi Order's ban on marriage due to his species' low birth rate and had a polygamous family of five wives and seven children, although he tried to avoid developing emotional attachments to them. Like many Cereans of his generation, Mundi favored his home world's isolation from the galaxy, speaking out against offworlder technology and encouraging Cerea to maintain their independence from the Republic. Mundi was held in high regard by members of the Jedi High Council, on which he occasionally sat in during the absence of Master Micah Giiett. He was eventually offered a permanent seat on the Council despite not yet having obtained the rank of Jedi Master. Before accepting, Mundi rescued his daughter Sylvn from the captivity of an agent of the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and in doing so uncovered a secret Cerean smuggling ring and illegal Trade Federation activities. Shortly after formally joining the Council in 33 BBY, Mundi was sent to seek the lost Jedi Sharad Hett on Tatooine. Following Hett's death, Mundi agreed to continue the Jedi training of his son, A'Sharad Hett. While Mundi and Hett grew close, the Cerean eventually agreed to turn his training over to Kuro after Hett felt tempted by the dark side of the Force during a lightsaber duel with bounty hunter Aurra Sing. As the Confederacy of Independent Systems uprising threatened the stability of the Republic, Mundi was among the Jedi dispatched to Geonosis in 22 BBY to confront the Separatist Droid Army, marking the beginning of the Clone Wars. Now a Jedi General commanding the Galactic Marines branch of the Grand Army of the Republic, Mundi participated in several major battles, including the battle of Hypori, where he barely survived a lightsaber duel against General Grievous. Mundi's entire family was killed during the Battle of Cerea, but the Jedi overcame his grief by further committing to his Jedi duties. He briefly assumed the Jedi training of Anakin Skywalker following Obi-Wan Kenobi's presumed death. Mundi also dueled the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress on Coruscant after exposing a spy from within the Galactic Senate working with her. Along with Kenobi and Luminara Unduli, Mundi led an assault against several Separatist battle droid foundries on Geonosis. As the Clone Wars approached conclusion, Mundi suggested to the Jedi High Council that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine may have become too powerful and that the Jedi Order might need to assume control of the Republic for an interim period until a transition of power could commence. Mundi was leading the Galactic Marines to battle on Mygeeto in 19 BBY when Palpatine began the Great Jedi Purge with Order 66, resulting in Mundi being shot to death by his own clone troopers.

Term: Obi-Wan Kenobi
Definition: Obi-Wan Kenobi, later known as Ben Kenobi during his exile, was a legendary Jedi Master who played a significant role in the fate of the galaxy during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. He was the mentor of both Anakin and Luke Skywalker, training both in the ways of the Force. He had a long and tumultuous career that helped shape the fate of the entire galaxy. Born in 57 BBY on Stewjon, Kenobi was taken as the Jedi apprentice of Qui-Gon Jinn and traveled on many missions with him. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Kenobi became the first Jedi in approximately 1,000 years to defeat a Sith Lord in combat when he defeated Darth Maul during the Second Battle of Theed, yet lost his master in the same duel. In 22 BBY, Kenobi found the Clone army on Kamino, and he was captured and almost executed in the Petranaki arena on Geonosis, along with Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala. The newly arrived clone troopers rescued them, but the following battle began the galaxy-wide Clone Wars. Kenobi fought during many battles of the Clone Wars, and was one of the last members of the Jedi High Council. Even after his apprentice became a Jedi Knight, Kenobi and Skywalker fought together many times, becoming a widely renowned pair. Kenobi earned the sobriquet "The Negotiator" through his charm and calm demeanor as well as the quiet threat of his abilities with a lightsaber. During the war, an old enemy returned to haunt Kenobi: Darth Maul, the murderer of Qui-Gon Jinn. With aid of his brother, Savage Opress, the revived Sith Lord went to create a criminal empire, all the while plotting revenge on his most despised adversary. Kenobi clashed blades with Maul on occasion across the galaxy. He was devastated as Maul slew the Jedi's past love interest, Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, in cold blood, yet remained strong throughout the conflict. Later in the war, Skywalker saved his life in a battle fought over Coruscant, after which Kenobi killed General Grievous on Utapau. However, he was soon betrayed, as Commander Cody, following Order 66, opened fire on him. Kenobi met up with his old mentor Grand Master Yoda, and the two realized that not many Jedi had survived the attacks. The two returned to the Jedi Temple, where they learned the agonizing truth: Skywalker, now lost to the dark side of the Force, had led an attack to kill all Jedi remaining in the Jedi Temple, following orders from Chancellor Palpatine, the ruler of the successor of the Republic, the Galactic Empire. Kenobi traveled to Mustafar in order to duel his former apprentice and friend, now the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Finally, Vader was taken in by a storm of lava, and Kenobi remorsefully left him to die. While Yoda, one of the few other Jedi to survive the Great Jedi Purge, went into exile, Kenobi took the son of Skywalker and Amidala, Luke Skywalker, to live with the Lars family on Tatooine. He became a friend of the young Skywalker as he grew up, but he did not tell Skywalker his actual identity. Kenobi re-emerged in 0 BBY, shortly before the Battle of Yavin. After Leia Organa, Vader's daughter and Luke Skywalker's twin sister, was captured by the Empire, she contacted him desperately. Kenobi gave Luke his father's lightsaber and traveled with him to Alderaan in Han Solo's Millennium Falcon, only to realize that the Death Star had destroyed the planet. Kenobi entered the Death Star with Luke, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2, in order to rescue Organa, but Darth Vader sensed his presence. In a duel with his former apprentice, Kenobi gave up his life to allow Luke to escape, vanishing into the Force the moment Vader struck him down with his weapon. Three years later, his spirit returned to Luke to lead him to Dagobah in order to learn from Master Yoda. He even carried out his role as a mentor to the younger Jedi beyond his natural life through use of the Force, remaining a significant influence on Luke Skywalker's foundation of the New Jedi Order.

Term: Zam Wesell

Term: Cad Bane
Definition: Cad Bane was a Duros male bounty hunter from the planet Duro who earned a reputation as the galaxy's best, deadliest, and most fearsome mercenary during the Clone Wars. Though he worked for a number of clients, his loyalty was ultimately to credits—and by extension, the highest bidder. Bane employed a variety of weapons and allies to ensure that he always got his pay, and he became the leader in his line of work after fellow bounty hunter Jango Fett perished in the opening battle of the war. His renown attracted the attention of Count Dooku and even the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, the latter of whom employed him numerous times for his own means. Working for Sidious, Bane stole a Jedi holocron from the Jedi Temple to unlock the Kyber memory crystal, a repository of all recorded Force-sensitive infants in the galaxy. After pilfering the crystal from Jedi Master Bolla Ropal on Devaron and forcing Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to unlock it, Bane was sent to kidnap four of the infants listed in the crystal. Despite being captured halfway through his job by Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, Bane escaped from Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu by luring them into a trap on his hideout, Black Stall Station. Bane was later hired by the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure and the Hutt Grand Council to break Jabba's criminal uncle, Ziro Desilijic Tiure, out of Republic custody on Coruscant. Forming a team of hunters to execute his job, Bane launched a brazen raid on the Republic Executive Building and captured ten prominent members of the Galactic Senate, using them as hostages to force Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to free Ziro. Once he had secured Ziro's release from the high-security Central Detention Center, Bane disbanded his posse and delivered Ziro to the Hutt Council. When Ziro escaped from their custody on Nal Hutta, Bane was re-hired to track down the crime lord. Though he arrived on Teth too late to secure his bounty, he managed to evade Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos, who failed to apprehend him for his crimes. At the close of the bounty hunting season, Bane's total bounties surpassed those of all others in field. After breaking criminal mastermind Moralo Eval out of the Republic's Central Detention Center, Bane became a candidate in Eval's plot to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine for Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Bane thus entered Eval's Box competition to become one of the five mercenaries who would be hired for the job. After passing the tournament alongside fellow hunters Embo, Derrown, Twazzi, and Rako Hardeen, Bane was personally selected by Dooku to lead the operation, and they traveled to Naboo to capture Chancellor Palpatine during the Festival of Light. Despite Bane's success with abducting Palpatine, Dooku betrayed him, having intended for the bounty hunters' operation to simply be a diversion for his own attempt to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor. Abandoned by Dooku, Bane was defeated by Hardeen, who turned out to be none other than Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had gone undercover to infiltrate and foil Eval's plans. Bane nevertheless retained his formidable reputation throughout the Clone Wars, after which he became one of the preferred freelancers for the Galactic Empire.

The name B-wing came from the craft's remote similarity in appearance to the lowercase letter "b", although its swordlike shape in attack mode has earned it the nickname "blade-wing", which may be another reason for the "b" prefix. Known as "crosses" due to their distinct shape, the B-wing was designed by the Verpine company Slayn &amp; Korpil in cooperation with then-Commander Gial Ackbar as part of the Shantipole Project. The B-wing, though difficult to fly, participated in numerous engagements across the galaxy during the latter parts of the Galactic Civil War, including the Battle of Endor and the liberation of Coruscant. The B-wing was used in its primary role of assault starfighter by both the New Republic and the Galactic Alliance throughout the Yuuzhan Vong War and beyond. Later models included a two-man version that could be used as a small transport.

Term: Battle Droid
Definition: Battle Droids are robotic, combat units used in the Star Wars Universe. Though developed earlier, battle droids served as frontline units in the Trade Federation Army and for the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars era. They were mass-produced on Confederate planets such as Geonosis, and some units survived into the Galactic Civil War and Legacy era. Battle droids were originally made by Trade Federation Viceroy, Nute Gunray, to prevent pirate attacks. When he was contacted by Darth Sidious, he attacked the peaceful planet of Naboo. The droids easily overwhelmed Naboo's military and put the people in camps where many died.A battle droid (also referred to as war droid, combat droid, or killer droid) was any droid designed for combat. There were numerous types of battle droids. They predated the Galactic Republic by thousands of years, with the earliest known being Rakatan ancient droids and the war-robots used by Xim the Despot. Many of the best known battle droids were those used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. At the end of the Clone Wars, Sith Lord Darth Vader turned off the Master control signal, deactivating most of the Separatist Droid Army. After this, battle droids were extremely rare.

Term: Super Battle Droid
Definition: One of the main design flaws of the standard B1 battle droid was its reliance on a Droid Control Ship to provide a signal; if the ships were disabled, the battle droids would become useless. To remedy this, the super battle droid did not rely on such a signal and had a greater capacity for independence. However, the droid still operated best with a command signal, otherwise they tended to forget about enemies as soon as they moved out of visual range. Additionally, the sturdy duranium frame of the super battle droid was larger and more heavily armored than those of a B1.[2] Unlike its predecessor, the B2's delicate processing unit and signal receptor were buried deep inside the torso, offering much more protection from enemy fire. Small dual laser cannons were mounted on their right forearms, along with a triShot weapon system. The B2's forearms could also be replaced by rocket launchers. They could use external weaponry (except in rocket launcher configuration), though their large hands had difficulty with smaller blasters. Instead, they were equipped with special blaster rifles that only responded to signal emitters built into the hands. For the sake of efficiency, they used many B1 parts. Their feet were also outfitted with specialized equipment for difficult terrain, such as climbing claws.[2] Their arms also were modular, capable of exchanging their laser cannon for grenade launchers and other specialized weaponry.

During the Clone Wars, Koon served as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic, leading soldiers in campaigns, fighting on Geonosis and at Kaliida Shoals amongst others. Koon was also an accomplished starfighter pilot. Koon had an uncle and a niece, Sha Koon, who was also a member of the Jedi Order, and served as a personal communicator between the Jedi strike force and the rest of the Republic during the Stark Hyperspace War. He was a close friend of fellow Masters Qui-Gon Jinn (whom he fought alongside during the Stark Hyperspace War), Micah Giiett, Ki-Adi-Mundi and noted fighter pilot Saesee Tiin. Plo Koon was shot down over Cato Neimoidia by his clone troopers, killing him in compliance with Order 66.

Term: Pre Vizsla
Definition: Pre Vizsla (pronounced /'pri vizlɑ/) was a male Human from Mandalore and was the leader of the Mandalorian Death Watch faction during the Clone Wars. Seeking to overthrow Duchess Satine Kryze and her pacifistic New Mandalorian government, in order to restore Mandalore to its widespread warrior ways, Vizsla secretly allied himself with Count Dooku and his Confederacy of Independent Systems. While governing Mandalore's moon, Concordia, and maintaining loyalty to Kryze in public, Vizsla led the Death Watch in secret from several Concordian mining camp bases. The Death Watch's terrorist attacks on Mandalore came to a head when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived on Concordia with Kryze to follow leads on the Death Watch. When Kenobi discovered the Death Watch's secret base, Vizsla confronted them with several warriors and revealed himself as the renegades' leader. After engaging Kenobi in a short duel, Vizsla forced him and Kryze to flee Concordia. Vizsla conspired with Mandalorian Senator Tal Merrik to capture Kryze during her journey to Coruscant, where she intended to plead her case directly to the Galactic Senate, but Merrik was defeated before he could complete his assignment. Amassing an army of Death Watch troops on Concordia in preparation to take over Mandalore, Vizsla was forced to wait until his and Dooku's plot to turn Mandalore against the Republic was completed. Vizsla dispatched a Death Watch assassin to Coruscant to kill Kryze, as her death would remove the opposition to the Senate's upcoming vote to have Republic troops occupy Mandalore—an occupation which would allow the Death Watch to gain the support of Mandalore populace and "liberate" them from the Republic. However, the assassin failed to murder Kryze, and the plot itself fell through, with the Senate voting against occupying Mandalore. With this turn of events, Vizsla was forced to postpone his attack on Mandalore, as his forces would be unable to hold the planet without its people's support. At some point, Vizsla and his soldiers came accross an escape pod lost in deep space which held the stranded Sith Lords Darth Maul and his brother Savage Opress. Harboring a common hatred of Obi-Wan Kenobi for his actions against them, they planned on having their revenge after their planned conquest of Mandalore. Gathering an army of criminals including the Hutts, the Pykes, and the Black Sun, Vizsla and Maul attacked Sundari, allowing Death Watch to act as heroes to a desperate population after the Duchess's forces failed to stop the criminals. With the support of the Mandalorian people, Vizsla ousted Satine and appointed himself Prime Minister and claimed the ancient title of Mand'alor. He also betrayed his Sith allies who were imprisoned but who managed to escape. Maul challenged Vizsla to a duel to determine the true ruler of the Mandalorians. After a long and difficult duel, Maul defeated Vizsla and executed him for his failures, before claiming his position as leader of the Death Watch.

Term: Savage Opress
Definition: Savage Opress was a Dathomirian Zabrak Nightbrother who became a Sith Lord alongside his younger brother, Darth Maul, during the Clone Wars. Originally a tribal leader on Dathomir, Opress was handpicked by the Nightsister Asajj Ventress to become her 'mate' and servant following her grueling tests of Selection, as part of her bid for revenge on her former Master, the Sith Lord Count Dooku. In accordance with their plot against Dooku, Mother Talzin and her Nightsister witches employed their dark magic to grant Opress fearsome abilities, placing him under their control. After murdering his beloved brother Feral in a display of loyalty to Ventress, Opress entered the Clone Wars as a Dark Acolyte, serving as an enforcer in Dooku's Confederacy of Independent Systems. He executed missions against the Galactic Republic at Devaron's Temple of Eedit and on Affa, slaying his first Jedi, Halsey and Knox, in the former campaign. Opress soon became a Sith apprentice to Dooku, who intended to use his new acolyte to overthrow his own Master, Darth Sidious, and claim control of the galaxy. While Opress was subjected to brutal Sith training under Dooku's charge, Ventress prepared to pit the monstrous Nightbrother against Dooku. Yet when Ventress's plans for revenge culminated at Toydaria, she and her ex-Master found that neither of them could contain Opress's impulsive nature and rage. In what became a three-way lightsaber duel, Opress overcame Ventress's spell of control and also terminated his service to Dooku, further battling his way through Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi before escaping to Dathomir. After learning from Talzin of his kinship to Darth Maul, Opress rescued his weakened brother from the depths of Lotho Minor and brought him home to Dathomir, where Talzin restored his mind and body. Opress then became involved with Maul's pursuit of vengeance on Kenobi, who had cut him in half over a decade ago on Naboo. Although Kenobi escaped from them with the aid of Asajj Ventress during a confrontation at Raydonia, Opress and Maul continued their plans for revenge and galactic domination, turning to the criminal underworld to achieve their needs. By 20 BBY, Opress and Maul cut a swath through the Outer Rim Territories, battling through all civilians, bounty hunters, and Jedi Knights who stood in their way. The Jedi High Council sent task forces to hunt them down on Pleem's Nexus and Moorjhone, with Kenobi always among the contenders. As part of Maul's plans, Opress became a Sith Lord, but he was forced to become the apprentice—submitting to his brother, the Master—in accordance with the Rule of Two. While attempting to recruit Weequay pirates into their service on Florrum, Opress killed Jedi Master Adi Gallia, though he soon thereafter lost his left arm to Kenobi's blade. Kenobi then chased Opress and Maul off Florrum, destroying their ship and leaving them stranded until they were discovered by members of the Death Watch, a group of Mandalorian warriors led by Pre Vizsla. Opress, Maul, the Mandalorians, and various criminal groups in the galaxy formed an alliance to overthrow the pacifist rulers of the planet Mandalore, though after the operation ended succesfully, Viszla and his men arrested Opress and Maul. After breaking free from prison with Mandalore's incarcerated Prime Minister, Almec, Opress and his brother seized control of Mandalore from Viszla and his allies. Their rule of Mandalore, however, attracted unwanted attention from Maul's former Master, Darth Sidious, who saw the power of the two Sith brothers as a threat to the dominance of his Sith Order. Sidious traveled to Mandalore and confronted the two brothers, fatally impaling Opress, who in his dying breath expressed regret for never having been Maul's equal.

Term: Obi-Wan Kenobi
Definition: Jedi, Anikan's Master

Term: Asoka Tano
Definition: Anakins apprentice

Term: Captain Rex (Star Wars: The Clone Wars)
Definition: Clone Captain Rex served the Republic during the Clone Wars, often taking orders from Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano. He viewed military service as an honor, and he always completed his mission. Fond of using two blaster pistols at the same time, Rex customized his armor with distinctive blue markings. His loyalty to the Republic and his Jedi Generals was absolute, but even this dedicated veteran soldier found himself plagued by doubts as the Clone Wars claimed more lives and brought ruin to more worlds.

Term: Commander Cody
Definition: A natural and practical leader in the clone army, Cody was a good fit for General Kenobi, to whom he was particularly loyal. Cody's keen ability to strategize, combined with his fierce combat style in the heat of battle, earned him the respect of the Jedi, and of his fellow clones as well. He often worked with Captain Rex, with whom he became friends. Cody enjoyed a close relationship with Kenobi, often sharing a tension-busting joke with him during intense moments on the battlefield. When Darth Sidious gave Order 66, however, Cody's loyalty to Kenobi was eclipsed by his clone indoctrination, and he ordered his troops to fire on the Jedi.

Term: Commander Fox
Definition: Commander Fox led the Coruscant Guard, an elite clone trooper unit assigned to serve as peace-keepers on the Galactic Republic capital. Like every other clone trooper in the Guard, Fox was bound by honor and duty to protect and serve the Supreme Chancellor and the members of the Galactic Senate. Utterly fearless, he was always the first to lead the charge into battle, even in the most perilous combat situations. His exemplary performance has made him one of the most highly decorated soldiers in the Republic army.

Term: Commander Gree
Definition: Clone Commander Gree, designation 1004, led the Elite Corps of clone troopers during the Clone Wars. He saw deployments on such heated battlefronts as Kashyyyk. Gree himself wore camouflaged armor to better blend into jungle surroundings. Though a faithful commander who carried out the Jedi's orders, Gree was ultimately loyal to the Republic. When Chancellor Palpatine enacted Order 66, Gree understood it was a worst-case scenario contingency -- the Jedi had betrayed the Republic, and were therefore dangerous enemies of the state.

Term: Commander Fil
Definition: CC-3714, nicknamed "Fil," was a veteran clone trooper commander in the Grand Army of the Republic who was assigned to recently promoted Jedi Knight Nahdar Vebb during the Clone Wars. In 22 BBY, he led a squad of clone troopers on a mission to the third moon of Vassek, in the Outer Rim Territories.

Term: Clone Trooper Waxer
Definition: Waxer served as part of Ghost Company, under the command of Clone Commander Cody during the campaigns to retake Ryloth and Geonosis. Waxer and Boil were often an inseparable pair, and together formed a recon team scouting the abandoned Twi'lek village of Nabat. There, they found a young girl named Numa, the sole survivor of a Separatist assault. Though the hard-edged Boil at first didn't want anything to do with the little girl, Waxer was compassionate and decided to protect her well-being. Numa proved extremely resourceful, guiding Waxer and Boil through underground passages that allowed them to bypass Separatist forces.

Term: Clone Trooper Boil
Definition: When trooper Waxer was en route to Ryloth on a mission to liberate its besieged population of Twi'leks, he was at first callously dismissive of their plight. "If we're here to free the tail-heads, the least they can do is get out of our way," he said. But, time spent on the planet with a brave little survivor of a Nabat village opened Boil's eyes. The resourceful girl, Numa, guided Boil and his squadmate Waxer through hidden passageways beneath the village, which proved crucial in freeing hostages held by the Separatists. To honor Numa, Boil had a cartoon illustration of Numa added to his helmet.

Term: Clone Trooper Jessie
Definition: The clone troopers of the 501st Legion are a tight-knit bunch, loyal to the end to their Jedi General, Anakin Skywalker. Jesse was a hard-fighting patriot who proudly wore the cog-shaped symbol of the Galactic Republic on his helmet, and as a large tattoo that covered his face.

Term: Clone Trooper Kix
Definition: Kix served as a medic in the 501st Legion of clone troopers. He is equipped with medpacs and other first aid equipment to help tend to his fellow squadmates in the thick of battle. Though Kix is dedicated to preserving the life of his fellow brothers, he has no qualms about fighting the enemy. Stencilled across his head is the phrase, "a good droid is a dead one" as testament to his mettle.

Term: Clone Trooper Hardcase
Definition: "Let me at 'em!" was Hardcase's typical reaction when presented with enemy forces, no matter how overwhelming the odds. Legend has it that his growth chamber sprung a leak during his formation on Kamino, resulting in his characteristic, somewhat aberrant, but nonetheless useful hyperactivity. When the blaster bolts fly, Hardcase loses all sense of self-preservation and returns fire with zeal, determined to wipe out the enemy with repeated sweeps of his rotary laser cannon.

Term: Clone Trooper Tup
Definition: A rookie clone trooper in the 501st Legion, Tup acclimated well within the ranks of seasoned veterans. Unlike some of the newer clones, like Dogma, who seemed wound a little too tight, Tup was far more willing to learn from his brothers' experiences. Tup could be distinguished by the teardrop shaped tattoo on his face, and the matching markings on his helmet. He served during the grueling campaign to retake the shadowy planet Umbara, under the command of the fierce General Pong Krell.

Term: Arc Trooper Fives
Definition: Also known as CT-27-5555, Fives trained with Domino Squad on Kamino before being shipped out to the Rishi Moon listening outpost. He survived the Separatist attack on the station there, and was transferred to the 501st Legion alongside his squadmate and fellow survivor, Echo. Fives and Echo were promoted to ARC trooper status after the defense of Kamino from Separatist invaders. He and Echo were later assigned with the difficult mission of freeing Republic prisoners from the daunting Citadel prison installation on Lola Sayu. He and Echo were later part of a mission to free Republic prisoners from the Separatist prison called the Citadel. Echo fell in battle, leaving Fives as Domino Squad's sole survivor. Fives accompanied the clone trooper Tup to Kamino for medical testing, where he discovered a terrifying secret about the clones' origins and ultimate purpose.

Term: Arc Trooper Echo
Definition: Echo was a soldier in the Grand Army of the Republic, known for his strict adherence to orders and rules -- hence, his nickname, which was sarcastically gifted by his clone brothers. Still, Echo proved to be among the bravest clones, integral in the defense of Rishi Station and Tipoca City, and eventually achieved the rank of ARC trooper. Through tragic circumstances, however, he would become something more than a normal clone.

Term: Clone Commander Wolffe
Definition: Clone Commander Wolffe (clone designation CC-3636) served under General Plo Koon in the Clone Wars, as commander of the tight-knit unit known as the Wolfpack. A seasoned and battered combatant, Wolffe has witnessed some of the worst the war has to offer. Early in the Clone Wars, he lost his entire command when Master Plo's flagship, Triumphant, was destroyed by the despicable General Grievous. Despite such tragedy, he fights on bravely, proudly brandishing his battle scars and instilling loyalty among his men.
